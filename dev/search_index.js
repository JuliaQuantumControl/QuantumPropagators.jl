Must include at least to points in order to determine the propagation time step to prepare. If the propagation will be over a tlist with a variable dt, the full tlist must be passed here.\ngenerator: An exemplary (non-time-dependent) dynamical generator. For full generality (if method=:cheby), the given generator should have a spectral range sufficiently large to encompass the entire propagation. If given multiple times, a spectral envelope enclosing all the generators will be determined automatically. In this case, you should pass the generators with the extremal values of all the controls.\nmethod: The propagation method to use. The default value of :auto attempts to choose the best method available, based on the properties of the given state, tlist, and generator. Alternative values are :cheby and :newton, and :expprop.\n\nAll other kwargs are filtered and passed to the contructor for returned workspace, e.g. limit for method=:cheby or m_max for method=:newton.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"api/#QuantumPropagators.propagate","page":"API","title":"QuantumPropagators.propagate","text":"Propagate a state over an entire time grid.\n\npropagate(state, genfunc, tlist, method=:auto;\n          backwards=false; storage=nothing,\n          observables=(<store state>, ), hook=nothing)\n\npropagates state over the time grid in tlist, using piecewise-constant dynamical generators (Hamiltonians or Liouvillians) determined by genfunc, and returns the resulting propagated state. The propagation is performed by calling propstep! for every interval in tlist.\n\nFor the i'th time interval, genfunc(tlist, i) must return the generator for that time interval. Generally, when approximating a time-continuous dynamical generator as piecewise-constant on the time grid, it should be evaluated at the midpoint of the interval. A possible exception is the first and last interval, which may be better evaluated at tlist[1] and tlist[end] to ensure exact boundary conditions like control fields that are exactly zero.\n\nIn addition to the two positional parameters indicating the time interval, genfunc will also receive the state (the input state for the propagation step), backwards, storage, observables, and init as keyword arguments. These additional parameters may be used for unusual equations of motion beyond the standard Schrödinger or Liouville-von-Neumann equation, e.g. state would enter the genfunc for a Gross–Pitaevskii equation. For standard equations of motion that do not use the additional parameters, it is best to capture the keyword arguments to genfunc with a definition like\n\ngenfunc(tlist, i; kwargs...) = ...\n\nFor valid propagation methods, see initpropwrk.\n\nIn general, there is no requirement that tlist has a constant time step, although some propagation methods (most notably cheby!) only support a uniform time grid.\n\nIf storage is given as an Array, it will be filled with data determined by the observables. The default \"observable\" results in the propagated states at every point in time being stored. The storage array should be created with init_storage. See its documentation for details.\n\nThe storage parameter may also be given as true, and a new storage array will be created internally with init_storage and returned instead of the propagated state.\n\nIf backwards is true, the input state is assumed to be at time tlist[end], and the propagation progresses backwards in time (with a negative time step dt). If storage is given, it will be filled back-to-front during the backwards propagation.\n\nIf hook is given as a callable, it will be called after each propagation step, as hook(state, generator, tlist, i, wrk, observables) where i is the index of the time interval on tlist covered by the propagation step (0 for the initial state, respectives lastindex(tlist) for the backward propagation).  The hook is called before calculating any observables. Example usage includes writing data to file, or modyfing state, e.g. removing amplitude from the lowest and highest level to mitigate \"truncation error\".\n\nThe propagate routine returns the propagated state at tlist[end], respectively tlist[1] if backwards=true, or a storage array with the stored states / observable data if storage=true.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"api/#QuantumPropagators.propstep!-Tuple{Any, Any, Any, ChebyWrk}","page":"API","title":"QuantumPropagators.propstep!","text":"Perform a single propagation step in-place.\n\npropstep!(state, generator, dt, wrk;, kwargs...)\n\nThe propagation method is determined by wrk, see initpropwrk.
