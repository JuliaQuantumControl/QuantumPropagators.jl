```julia
m = arnoldi!(Hess, q, m, Ψ, H, dt=1.0; extended=true, norm_min=1e-15)
```

Calculate the Hessenberg matrix and Arnoldi vectors of `H dt`, from `Ψ`.

For a given order `m`, the `m×m` Hessemberg matrix is calculated and stored in
in the pre-allocated `Hess`. Further  an array of `m` normalized Arnoldi
vectors is stored in in the pre-allocated `q`, plus one additional unnormalized
Arnoldi vector.  The unnormalized `m+1`st vector could be used to easily
extend a given `m×m` Hessenberg matrix to a `(m+1)×(m+1)` matrix.

If the extended Hessenberg matrix is requested (`extended=true`, default), the
`m+1`st Arnoldi vector is also normalized, and it's norm will be stored in
`m+1, m` entry of the (extended) Hessenberg matrix, which is an `(m+1)×(m+1)`
matrix.

Return the size `m` of the calculated Hessenberg matrix. This will usually be
the input `m`, except when the Krylov dimension of `H` starting from `Ψ` is
less then `m`. E.g., if `Ψ` is an eigenstate of `H`, the returned `m` will
be 1.

See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnoldi_iteration> for a description of
the algorithm.

# Arguments

- `Hess::Matrix{ComplexF64}`: Pre-allocated storage for the Hessemberg matrix.
   Can be uninitialized on input. The matrix must be at least of size `m×m`, or
   `(m+1)×(m+1)` if `extended=true`. On output, the `m×m` sub-matrix of `Hess`
   (with the returned output `m`) will contain the Hessenberg matrix, and all
   other elements of `Hess` be be set to zero.
- `q`: Pre-allocated array of states similar to `Ψ`, as storage for the
  calculated Arnoldi vectors. These may be un-initialized on input. Must be at
  least of length `m+1`
- `m`: The requested dimensions of the output Hessenberg matrix.
- `Ψ`: The starting vector for the Arnoldi procedure. This can be of any type,
   as long as `Φ = H * Ψ` results in a vector similar to `Ψ`, there is an inner
   products of `Φ` and `Ψ` (`Ψ⋅Φ` is defined), and `norm(Ψ)` is defined.
- `H`: The operator (up to `dt`) for which to calculate the Arnoldi procedure.
  Can be of any type, as long as `H * Ψ` is defined.
- `dt`: The implicit time step; the total operator for which to calculate the
  Arnoldi procedure is `H * dt`
- `extended`: If `true` (default), calculate the extended Hessenberg matrix,
  and normalized the final Arnoldi vector
- `norm_min`: the minimum value of the norm of `Ψ` at which `Ψ` should be
   considered the zero vector
