"""Propagate a state over an entire time grid.

```julia
state = propagate(
    state,
    generator,
    tlist;
    method,  # mandatory keyword argument
    check=true,
    backward=false,
    inplace=QuantumPropagators.Interfaces.supports_inplace(state),
    verbose=false,
    piecewise=nothing,
    pwc=nothing,
    storage=nothing,
    observables=<store state>,
    callback=nothing,
    show_progress=false,
    init_prop_kwargs...)
```

propagates `state` of the entire time grid and returns the propagated states,
or a storage array of data collected during the propagation. This high-level
routine performs the following three steps:

1.  If `check=true` (default), check that `state`, `generator`, and `tlist` are
    consistent with the required interface.

2.  Initialize a `propagator` via [`init_prop`](@ref):

    ```
    init_prop(state, generator, tlist; method, inplace, init_prop_kwargs...)
    ```

3.  Call and return the result of

    ```
    propagate(propagator; storage, observables, show_progress, callback)
    ```

# Arguments

* `state`: The "initial" state for the propagation. For `backward=false`, this
  state is taken to be at initial time (`tlist[begin]`); and for
  `backward=true`, at the final time (`tlist[end]`)
* `generator`: The time-dependent generator of the dynamics
* `tlist`: The time grid over which which the propagation is defined. This may
  or may not be equidistant.

# Mandatory keyword arguments

* `method`: The propagation method to use. May be given as a name
  (`Symbol`), but the recommended usage is to pass a module implementing the
  propagation method, cf. [`init_prop`](@ref).

# Optional keyword arguments

* `check`: if `true`, check that `state`, `generator`, and `tlist` pass
  [`check_state`](@ref), [`check_generator`](@ref) and [`check_tlist`](@ref),
  respectively.
* `backward`: If `true`, propagate backward in time
* `inplace`: If `true`, propagate using in-place operations. If `false`, avoid
  in-place operations. Not all propagation methods
  support both in-place and not-in-place propagation. Note that `inplace=true`
  requires that [`QuantumPropagators.Interfaces.supports_inplace`](@ref) for
  `state` is `true`.
* `piecewise`: If given as a boolean, ensure that the internal `propagator` is
  an instance of [`PiecewisePropagator`](@ref), cf. [`init_prop`](@ref).
* `pwc`: If given a boolean, do a piecewise constant propagation where the
  generator in each interval is constant (the internal `propagator` is a
  [`PWCPropagator`](@ref), cf. [`init_prop`](@ref))
* `storage`: Flag whether to store and return the propagated states /
  observables, or pre-allocated storage array. See Notes below.
* `observables`: Converters for data to be stored in `storage`. See Notes
  below.
* `callback`: Function to call after each propagation step. See Notes below.
* `show_progress`: Whether to show a progress bar. See Notes below.

All remaining keyword arguments are passed to [`init_prop`](@ref) to initialize
the [`Propagator`](@ref AbstractPropagator) that is used internally to drive
the optimization. Unknown keyword arguments will be ignored.

# Notes

In general, there is no requirement that `tlist` has a constant time step,
although some propagation methods (most notably [`Cheby`](@ref
QuantumPropagators.Cheby.cheby!)) only support a uniform time grid.

If `storage` is given as a container pre-allocated via [`init_storage`](@ref),
it will be filled with data determined by the `observables`. Specifically,
after each propagation step,

```julia
data = map_observables(observables, tlist, i, state)
write_to_storage!(storage, i, data)
```

is executed, where `state` is defined at time `tlist[i]`.
See [`map_observables`](@ref) and [`write_to_storage!`](@ref) for details. The
default values for `observables` results simply in the propagated states at
every point in time being stored.

The `storage` parameter may also be given as `true`, and a new storage array
will be created internally with [`init_storage`](@ref) and returned instead of
the propagated state:

```julia
data = propagate(
    state, generator, tlist; method,
    backward=false; storage=true, observables=observables,
    callback=nothing, show_progress=false, init_prop_kwargs...)
```

If `backward` is `true`, the input state is assumed to be at time
`tlist[end]`, and the propagation progresses backward in time (with a negative
time step `dt`). If `storage` is given, it will be filled back-to-front during
the backward propagation.

If `callback` is given as a callable, it will be called after each propagation
step, as `callback(propagator, observables)` where `propagator` is
[`Propagator`](@ref AbstractPropagator) object driving the propagation.
The `callback` is called before calculating any observables, or storing the
propagated state in `storage`. Example usage includes writing data to file, or
modifying `state` via [`set_state!`](@ref), e.g., removing amplitude from the
lowest and highest level to mitigate "truncation error".

If `show_progress` is given as `true`, a progress bar will be shown for
long-running propagation. In order to customize the progress bar,
`show_progress` may also be a function that receives `length(tlist)` and
returns a `ProgressMeter.Progress` instance.

If `in_place=false` is given, the propagation avoids in-place operations. This
is slower than `inplace=true`, but is often required in the context of
automatic differentiation (AD), e.g., with
[Zygote](https://fluxml.ai/Zygote.jl/). That is, use `in_place=false` if
`propagate` is called inside a function to be passed to `Zygote.gradient`,
`Zygote.pullback`, or a similar function. In an AD context, `storage` and
`show_progress` should not be used.

The `propagate` routine returns the propagated state at `tlist[end]`,
respectively `tlist[1]` if `backward=true`, or a storage array with the
stored states / observable data if `storage=true`.
