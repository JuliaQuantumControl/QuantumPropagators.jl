# Internal utility functions for PiecewisePropagators
#
# These allow to eliminate code duplication between the various sub-types of
# PiecewisePropagators, e.g., ChebyPropagator, NewtonPropagator, ExpPropagator.
# All of these types share the following conventions:
#
# * There is a `parameters` field that is a mapping `control` => `amplitude`,
#   where `amplitude` is the values of the control at the midpoints of the time
#   interval
# * There is a field `n` that stores the index of the next interval to
#   propagate
# * There is a field `t` that stores the time at which the current state
#   is defined
# * There is a field `generator` that contains the time-dependent generator,
#   e.g. a nested tuple `(H0, (H1, eps))`
# * There is a field `controls` that contains a list of all the controls in the
#   `generator` (usually functions or amplitude vectors)
# * There is a field `genop` that is pre-allocated for a static operator that
#   is the `generator` evaluated for a specific interval
#
# These conventions are not universally enforced. That is, a user may define a
# new PiecewisePropagator that does not follow these conventions. Thus, the
# functions defined in this file are always called explicitly, not implicitly
# via dispatch on PiecewisePropagator.
